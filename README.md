# Classification of Light using Beta-Variational Autoencoder

This is the CIS 731 Artificial Neural Network course final project. It was developed under the guidance of Prof. Pankaj K. Jha and Prof. Chilukuri K. Mohan, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,  Syracuse University, New York, USA. 

This project aims to classify quantum light sources. The Data is preprocessed and fed to the Neural network. 

The accuracy and loss of the VAE network are recorded by providing different data sets, and a graph is plotted. A statistical ML technique fits the graph and generalizes the data.

Note: The data set used for this project is provided upon request.
